## Is OpenBubbles safe to use?&#x20;

Everything happens locally, on your phone. Anything that happens is strictly between you and Apple. An immense effort has been made to ensure a reliable and safe experience. That being said, iMessage is a complex and changing system, and every situation cannot be predicted. Most issues will only affect OpenBubbles, and will not affect other devices or your account. In extremely rare cases, your account may be temporarily (day or two) or permanently blocked. In permanent cases, a call with Apple support will usually lift the block.
::: warning
You are responsible for who you share your hardware identifiers with. If someone uses your hardware identifiers to send mass spam, your device _**will**_ be blocked, and you will only have yourself to blame. If you share one device with over 20 users, you may experience issues.

## Can I use a VM with OpenBubbles?
::: danger
**Do not use data from a virtual machine.** **No**, it doesn't matter that iMessage works in the VM. **No**, your generated data is not "special" or "approved". Apple *knows* your hardware info is phony and any success you on the VM get is Apple being nice. Register another time with OB and there is a decent chance your account will be banned. Don't say I didn't warn you.

## What is "Hardware Info"?&#x20;

During iMessage activation, your machine's hardware identifiers (serial number, board ID, model, etc.) are sent to Apple for validation. 
OpenBubbles requires valid machine identifiers to send to Apple during activation. OpenBubbles refers to this data as "hardware info".

## How can I obtain hardware info?

See [activation](/quickstart.html#activate-openbubbles)

## What if I do not have access to a Mac?

If you don't have access to a Mac, ask a friend to share their code with you. They can share it from the hardware info app on the Mac, or from settings inside OpenBubbles. One Mac can be used by up to 20 users (unlimited logins).

## Does the Mac need to stay online?&#x20;

No! Once you have setup OpenBubbles, feel free to turn off, discard, or do anything you wish with your Mac. Keep in mind the physical Mac may still be useful for troubleshooting.

## What does "prevent sharing" do?

* Enabling "prevent sharing" applies a few restrictions to generated codes:
* Can only be used once (text codes only)
* Expire after 48 hours (text codes only)
* Cannot be shared to other users after completing setup.

## Will the Mac I use have access to my account?
No. OpenBubbles impersonates the Mac, and the Mac is not even aware of the login and doesn't have any of the associated keys. If you see the Mac logged in on your Apple ID page, you are seeing OpenBubbles.

## Disable Foreground Service Notification
This notification is not needed for OpenBubbles to function.

To disable, either:
* Go to your device settings, search for notification settings for OpenBubbles, and disable the category "Foreground Service".
* Wait for a Foreground Service notification to appear, tap and hold on the notification, press the gear, and disable the category "Foreground Service".
* Go to OpenBubbles app info page, tap "Notifications" and disable the category "Foreground Service".

If you are using a Samsung Device and do not see notification categories you have to enable the "Manage notification categories for each app" option.
To do this you have to go into Settings -> Notifications -> Advanced Settings -> toggle manage notification categories for each app.

## Can I register my phone number with OpenBubbles?

If you have an iPhone running the relay app, yes. The phone must stay online at all times. Enter the relay code on the hardware identifier screen, and you will be prompted to register your number. Please refer to the [Phone Number Registration](pnr) page for more information.
